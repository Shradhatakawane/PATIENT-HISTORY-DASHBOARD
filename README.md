## Problem Statement

Healthcare providers face challenges in efficiently managing and leveraging patient history data to deliver personalized and effective care. The manual and fragmented nature of collecting, storing, and accessing patient history information across different healthcare systems and departments impedes care coordination, diagnostic accuracy, and treatment outcomes.

## Expected Outcomes:

The patient history analytics dashboard is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

Consolidate and centralize patient history data from disparate sources into a single, comprehensive view.
Provide healthcare providers with timely access to relevant patient health information to support clinical decision-making and care coordination.
Identify patterns and trends in patient health data to proactively manage chronic conditions, prevent adverse events, and improve patient outcomes.
Enhance communication and collaboration among multidisciplinary care teams by facilitating data sharing and knowledge exchange.
Improve patient satisfaction and engagement by involving patients in their care plans and treatment decisions based on a thorough understanding of their health history.
